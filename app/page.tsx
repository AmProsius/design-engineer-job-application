              I wanted to tell you more about my current job status, but I
              honestly can&apos;t find better words than <em>Robin Malfait</em>{" "}

            <p>
              Let's begin at how and why I ended up being where I am today. When
              I was a kid, my dad and I would build Lego figures and take photos
              of them. We then imported the photos to Photoshop 8.0, manually
              removed the background and placed the figures onto a more fitting
              background like a volcano or a jungle.
            </p>
            <Gallery />
            <p>
              In the subsequent years, I mastered Photoshop with the help of{" "}
              <ExternalLink href="https://www.youtube.com/howardpinsky">
                Howard Pinsky
              </ExternalLink>{" "}
              (formerly known as <em>Iceflow Studios</em>). This obsession
              helped me gain access to an internship at a software engineering
              company which ultimately resulted in a apprenticeship and later a
              permanent employment.
            </p>
            <p>
              There I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or rather{" "}
              <ExternalLink href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</ExternalLink>)
              and PHP from scratch. We later used{" "}
              <ExternalLink href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</ExternalLink>{" "}
              for PHP development and{" "}
              <ExternalLink href="https://getbootstrap.com/">
                Bootstrap
              </ExternalLink>{" "}
              as our CSS framework. When Tailwind CSS arrived, I wasn't
              convinced at first. It felt like using inline styles (ugh!). But
              with the arrival of React and Vue, all of that changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started using Nuxt with{" "}

                API Platform

              and quickly discovered Tailwind CSS's huge potential. I then
              became some kind of upgrade specialist for migrating Bootstrap to
              Tailwind CSS, which was a lot of fun. I also tried to{" "}

              some cool things from Tailwind to Bootstrap and bring my Symfony
              and Nuxt knowledge back to Tailwind CSS (

              with Premiere Pro and After effects and I absolutely love to cut
              videos based on their soundtrack. To learn more about After
              Effects would be super fun for me.

              Pixel-perfect design is a passion of mine. That is one of the
              reasons I use Heroicons btw. I am a true perfectionist, but I also
              know when to put something aside if the priorities shift. If you
              let me loose though, I will not rest before my work is perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also I'm an official trainer since 2017. In Germany, we have
              something called an apprenticeship, which is usually a period of
              three years to learn a professional field. The trainees have to
              visit a professional school for one or two times a week and are
              taught in the company the rest of the time. The apprenticeship I
              train can be roughly translated to <em>Digital Media Designer</em>
              . So I already have about 7 years of experience in teaching the
              stuff I know in person.

              This may come as a surprise, but I'm very much looking forward to
              pimp the documentation. I've always loved writing and reading
              documentations, but most of the stuff I wrote lies in company
              internal Confluence documents. The last thing I wrote and designed
              was a{" "}

                Storybook
              </ExternalLink>{" "}
              for our current component library which we plan to publish at some
              point.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also very excited about teaching the things that I will learn
              along the way. I never actually got or took the time to do it, but
              the urge is still within me. One thing I'm already good at though
              is giving{" "}
              <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/amprosius/status/1723394545197400340">
                honest feedback

              when being asked so. Gotta build that audience somehow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Can't wait to add a command palette to Catalyst, if I'm honest.
              This trend is one of the coolest trends in the last few years and
              it would be an honor to build and perfect this one for a broader
              audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              New templates for Tailwind UI are also very tempting. I already
              have a few in the back of my head and I would love to share some
              ideas in a private interview!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a huge fan of style guides and design systems, so naturally I
              was very excited for Tailwind UI and Catalyst. To work on either
              of those would be a dream come true.

              , accessibility is a big topic for me. It&apos;s not affecting me
              directly, but I&apos;ve been in contact with people with
              disabilities from all over the world since I have been diagnosed

              became stable late last year, I immediately started migrating our
              existing components to React Aria Components, which allowed us to
              have a ton of accessibility features out of the box. I hate to

              that enhance the user experience. It's a thin line between a
              joyful animation and a distracting animation, so I try to evaluate
              every animation I use on a project. We currently use a lot of

              for icon animation, but we soon felt it was just to big of a
              dependency for such a small use case. I then rebuilt all of the
              icon animations that were previously done in After Effects as
              animated SVG paths with Framer Motion and that was just a game
              changer.

              For me, minimalism is not only about having less physical stuff,
              it's also about de-cluttering my life. I have since changed
              relationships, diets and finances. When less is more, I can focus
              on the important things and leave behind anything that blocks me
              in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, having less stuff makes moving a breeze. I recently moved
              into a new flat and I had no more than eight removal crates to
              move <em>all my belongings</em> (aside from furniture). I invited
              a friend over and we moved everything in four hours. That includes
              fixing up the furniture!
